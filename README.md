# TomTom Scenery Backend

The purpose of the TomTom Scenery Backend application is to return specific information about a Point Of Interest (POI) to the frontend. To get the specific POI information the backend uses the information it gets from the GET-Request. The GET-Request contains 3 pieces of information:

- Chosen category
- Latitude
- Longitude

Based on that information the TomTom Scenery Backend application will build a URL that will retrieve all the POI data from the TomTom API. When it has all the information, it extracts the specific information it needs, stores it into objects and sends these objects to the frontend in the form of a List.
